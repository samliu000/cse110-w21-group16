## Context and Problem Statement

  This week Shuhua and Yuru work together on the project design part, we will reviewing the project design and make decision on which design we are going to use for our pomodora timer. 

## Decision Drivers 

* Shuhua and Yuru, "add task" design 
* Shuhua, how do we start the timer?
* Shuhua and Yuru, timer percentage
* Shuhua, the list check up
* Yuru, how to acknowledge usr the concentrate time and break time?
* Fengdi, the timer range
* Shuhua, what will happen if 5 mins break is done


## Considered Options

* When we are going to add new task to the list, the "add task" should be looks a line or "add task" is a box pop up when user is going to add new task 
* When user want to start the timer, they should first to start the timer or they should select the task? If the user just want to use the timer, what should they do?
* Once the user finish the timer, do we want to ask the user to check the task box or automatically check?
* Do we use a question mark, or other symbol to knowledge users the concentrate time and break time.
* Do we have a longer timer range?
* When the break finish, pop up the question box? or let the users to fill it our? 


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 
* When the user using the pomodora timer, they will select the task then start the timer. Because this is easier to implement.
* When the user is going to add new task, the "add task" will be a line in website version, and will be a box in app version.
* Once the users feel the task is done, they will mark the task as done.
* We will use a question mark to show users how the pomodora timer works.
* We have two buttons, one is start button and the other is reset button. 
* For this week, we will focus on working on the 25 mins timer. Once we done we will working on adjustable timer.
* Once one task is done, the users will select new task or not, because we wish the users have more flexibility to choose keep working or take a break.
