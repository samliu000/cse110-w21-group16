Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement

When the task is completed, how does our program know?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* Give a checkbox and let the user check it themself
* ask after each pomodoro if the user finished their task

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "let user check tasks off themself", because automating it might end up being too much work and would introduce many edge cases. We want to give the user more control and letting them check it off themselves is not only intuitive, but also still let's us ahieve our goals in related features.
