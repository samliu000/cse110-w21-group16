# What do we see?

- COVID-19 exposed one of the problems that students have been facing even before the transition to online classes.  
We lack self-accountability when it comes to being productive and effective when addressing our responsibilities at school.   
The setting of online learning has enhanced our exposure to several sources of distractions, such as our phones, laptops, roommates.  
- Sometimes the sheer number of todo items in our lives can be overwhelming and as a result we simply don’t do any.  

## What do we need?  

- We need a sense of accountability
- We need training to be disciplined
- We need to minimize distractions

## Wouldn’t it be great to have...

- *Something* that designates a set time for work.
- *Something* that regulates our break so that it’s both refreshing and optimal.
- *Something* that allows me to measure my productivity throughout the day.
- *Something* that quantifies my efficiency when completing tasks.
- *Something* that teaches me my productivity patterns.

## Our pomodoro app will...

- *Designate* 25 minute work time with minimal distractions.
- *Allot* 5 minute break time to stimulate a healthy and optimal work session.
- *Provide* statistics that allow users to track their own productivity.
- *Encourage* users to make estimates in regards to their own efficiency.
- *Train* users to quantify and optimize their productivity.
- *Remind* users the tasks to tackle for the day .

## What is a pomodoro timer?

Purpose: encourage productivity by setting a 25 minute timer dedicated to work and 5 minute timer for resting.   

It's no surprise that there are many Pomodoro apps in the market. However, our approach is customer-centered and stands out by empowering users to optimize their:
- Productivity
- Attention span
- Time estimation skills
- Distraction-free work time 

For this reason, there is **no pause** button. We **facilitate** the use of the web app by guiding the users through pop-ups. We **circumvent** from adding connections to outside apps. We **avoid** visual options that might be more distracting than useful. We **Minimize** the complexity of the visual design for web app. All of this to ensure a successful 25 minute work session and a restoring 5 minute break.

## Let’s face it, our app will... 

- Enforce the pomodoro timer to enhance productivity, but the user is responsible to be faithful to follow   
the timer for both the work session (25 minutes) or the break period (5 minutes).
- Aid the user to be more accurate in how they estimate their own productivity,   
but the user is responsible to learn to empirically adjust their predictions.
- Help train the user to be more accountable when focusing on tackling the task at hand,  
but the user is responsible to minimize their exposure to other sources of distractions that might break the pomodoro session.


## This is how it looks like...

*Start/Reset Buttons*:

- User estimates number of Pomodoros the task will take
- User receives a comparison between their estimated and actual results.

In the future we may also expand to mobile:
