## Meeting 2.2

#### Wednesday 1/23/21, 4:00-4:40 pm on Zoom, Team 16/Skynet  
  - Attendees: Shuhua Xie, Yuru Zhou

#### Purpose: 
Get the prototype UI ready to share with the rest of the team. Discuss possible issues and possible solutions.

#### Things discussed  
How do users know there is a 5 minute break?
  - Perhaps a help button in the corner?
  - Maybe give a popup when you start to tell you when break is?
  - Note at bottom when the timer starts (after the todolist fades away)

Percentage:
  - Definitely need a loading bar visual
    - Should we keep the text?
  - to toggle: tap on the timer? Or button to toggle.
    - Decided on two icons, on the side
  - Maybe just counting up for percentage and just counting down for timer

Add Task:
  - popup on mobile, type in on desktop

Selecting task:
  - Select task before or after the timer?
    - before: pro: we can put a note below while the timer is on
    - cons of after: people will try to multi-task
  - How to implement selecting a task before?
    - maybe put start task under 3 dots
    - maybe prompt user after they press start

Estimation:
  - Should user be able to change it after making it?
    - No because it is to help them get better at estimating their time.

Three dots on side of tasks on desktop:
  - Delete
  - Start task?

Checking off:
  - Should user be able to check off the box?
