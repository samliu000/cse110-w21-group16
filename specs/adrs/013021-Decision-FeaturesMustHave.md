## Context and Problem Statement

  We have our team formed with team members in different roles. But we have no idea about our project, today we came up user stories and Brain Strom to decide which features are the must-have feature in our project.

## Decision Drivers 

* Shuahua, the project better have the feature: " Reward system: if you have finished 4 pomodra concentrate time, you will be rewarded a long break"
* Sammul, the project better have the feature: "25 mins focus, 5 mins break" or "30 mins focus, longer break" 
* Aven, the project better have the feature: " Have two seperate timer, one for school, one for work; use different themes to seperate; percentage"
* Fengdi, the project better have the feature: " Notification for break; and List"
* Shuahua, the project better have the feature: " Reward system: if you have finished 4 pomodra concentrate time, you will be rewarded a long break"
* Kevin, the project better have the feature: " Varity of "modes" the app can run in, example could adjust the concentrate time "
* Joshue, the project better have the feature: " The timer could change background"
* Yuru, the project better have the feature: " Priority system; Reminder function"
* Lara, the project better have the feature: " Recommendation for a distraction-free break; Only break button"
* Matias, the project better have the feature: " Timer itself; Start botton; Notications; Reset Button"


## Considered Options

* Project's Must have feature : Timer, List, Notifictions, or more 
* Timer's Must have feature : Start button, break button, notifications, or more 
* Does timer changing Theme: when it is on task the timer will be on Theme A; if user press break the timer will switch to Theme B 
* When Pomodora timer finsh: What the timer will interact with user?
* What will happen between two pomodora timers : ask users to choose or automatically trigger the break timer
* When we add the task list to the project: Do we want to use priority system to range tasks?
* How to implement the notification part: solove now or save for later?
* Timer and List feature: Yuru, Johuse, and Aven who take resopnsiblity of which feature?

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: 
* Project Must have features: Timer; List; Notifictions, because based on the users' stories these features are the must to have features for the pomodora timer.
* Timer's must have features: Start button; Break button; Pomodora finisish naturally, becuare as the timer the most basic funciton is start and break.
* When it is on task the timer will be on Theme A; if user press break the timer will switch to Theme B, because this will help the user adjustment themselves from working mode to relex mode.
* When Pomodora timer finsh: Will ask the user which task he/she worked on and ask if user finished, because this will help the users keep on track. 
* What happen if one pomodora timer finished: break will start once a pomodora timer is finished, because this will force the users to take a break and which is good for users' health. 
* When we add the task list to the project: We will use priority system to range tasks, because which will help users to track their tasks.
* We will talk about the notification part later. 
* List feature: Johuse will take responsiblity;
* Timer feature: Yuru and Aven will work on timer.
