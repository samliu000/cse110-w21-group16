* Status: tentatively accepted
* Deciders: majority vote
* Date: 02-06-2021

## Context and Problem Statement

How should the add task feature of the todo list look?

## Decision Drivers

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

* line on desktop and mobile
* box on desktop and mobile
* line on desktop, box on mobile

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "line on desktop, box on mobile", because having a a line on mobile would be difficult for the user, but the line option places everything there for the user.

Update: After attempting both implementatinos, we settled for a mix of the two: the "add task" button will make a add task for visible. This was chosen because it is intuitive and easily made responsive.
