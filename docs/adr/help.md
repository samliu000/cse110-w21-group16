* Deciders: Majority opinion, brought up in meeting with everyone present
* Date: 02-07-2021

## Context and Problem Statement

We are concerned that a user might be unfamiliar with how pomodoro timers work or confused by our UI.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional --

* Ease of programming and should not in the way of the user.

## Considered Options

* Have a tutorial feature when the user first enters the site
* Have a question mark in the corner that brings up a pop-up of instructions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Have a question mark with a popup" because this is easiest to implement and will not bother the user every time on start up.
