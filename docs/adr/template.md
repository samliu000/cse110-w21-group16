What would the BREAK button do?
    Just reset the timer, otherwise line between stop and pause is too thin.
    Don't want someone to think it's a pause button and accidentally click it. 

How much control does the user get? Is being 'locked' into the timer acceptable?
Is a button that allows the user to stop giving the user an incentive to press it?

How to do the log then?
