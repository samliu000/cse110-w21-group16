2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

Slack will be used to communicate between team members and collaborate on projects. All members will be expected to read emails from anyone in the group on a daily basis and respond in not more than 24 hours. Emails may be used for more important information that needs to be shared with the whole team. Files may be transferred over Slack or added individually to the team repo. Personal phone numbers are for worst case scenarios when no other means is working. 

3) Scheduling Meetings 

The meeting time will be determined by the best availability according to the when2meet form. Meetings will be held once a week on Saturdays from 3:00-3:45 pm. In order to change weekly meeting times, everyone one the team must be in agreement. If someone is absent for unavoidable reasons, they will be updated via Slack from the team leaders. Meetings may be recorded for safekeeping and used to review information. 

4) General Responsibilities for All Team Members

Communicating responsibly and respectfully.
Maintaining a positive attitude. 
Being accountable for mistakes and responsive to criticism.
No judgement over others, including for their mistakes.
Tasks will be delegated so that everyone contributes.
Members will communicate with each other in a reasonable timeframe as specified in point 2.

5) Conflict Resolution

Possible conflicts may be disagreement between team members, team members not meeting deadlines, team members being disrespectful, team members doing roles that were not assigned to them, etc.

Steps to resolve conflict will be followed in this order. If the current step does not resolve the issue move on to the next one.

Resolve the conflict personally by private messaging between the parties involved. 
Involve one or two moderators, team members not involved in the conflict, to help parties arrive to an agreement. 
Bring awareness of the issue to the whole team so that everyone may discuss.
Contact team leaders to ask TA for help to deal with the issue. 

6) Expectations of Faculty and GTA’s

If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
